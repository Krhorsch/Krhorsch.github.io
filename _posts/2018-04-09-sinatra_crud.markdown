The second project here at flatiron is to build a simple CRUD application. CRUD of course being an acronym for:
Create
Read
Update
Delete.

As I waded through this project it became more and more evident that at the root of almost all user interactive applications is a simple CRUD base.  I could see the directions I would need to go to develop a more complicated/enticing application as I worked on just the simple base app.

My biggest takeaway from this project was the importance of maximizing my resources.  Not only is google of course google but the Learn.co community is phenomenal is their willingness to help.  Personally I have also found it good practice to read everyone's questions to either reinforce knowledge I have or to build on the foundation I have built.
