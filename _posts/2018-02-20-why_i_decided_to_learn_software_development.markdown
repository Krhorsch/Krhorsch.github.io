I decided to learn software development for primarily 3 reasons:  

The first reason was out of necessity; for the past 4 years I have been installing solar at upwards of 70 hours a week.  All of this hard labor started taking a toll on my body and it became evident to me my body would not be able to withstand a 20 year career of manual labor.  Long story short, I needed a career change.

The second reason was for opportunity.  With a skillset in software development there are a variety of jobs you can take on across companies with different missions and cultures.  This is exciting!

The third primary reason I decided to learn computer programming is because I think I can be successful at it.  After completing some of the bootcamp prep work I found myself retaining information and being able to implement it.  Remembering to not get overwhelmed and problem solve one error or one task at a time is key!
