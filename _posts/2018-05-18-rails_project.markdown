I just completed my first rails app built from my own ideas.  Avi often says he likes to "write the code I wish I had".  This philosophy really rings true when trying to write your own application.  After implementing some control flow that was obvious, I opened up the rails server and would think about what the next logical step would be.  As I would navigate my own app and realize the steps I would need to take to move forward, other elements would catch my eye for opportunity to improve or implement.  

A feature that I was happy to display was the Average Rating of a Beer based on each Users input.  I accomplished this with the help of a scope method through my join table.

With 3 models one of which being a join to connect the other two my app is relatively rudimentary.  But an application in never "finished" different design can always be implemented as well as deeper logical features.

I am happy with my progress as a student and my desire to continue to be a student everyday even after hopefully landing a full-time tech job.
